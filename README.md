In this project, we use the optimization algorithms related to the randomization.

## Compile/Run the code
Python (jupyter)

0. The randomness could be improved by certain strategy with some imporvments from incremental gradient descent. 
1. With three example, we can conclude that the without-replacement test is better than the with ones.
